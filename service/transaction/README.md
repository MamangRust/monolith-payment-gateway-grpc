# Payment Gateway Transaction Service

## Overview

``TransactionService`` is a monolith responsible for managing balance top-up transactions. It supports monthly and yearly statistics based on method, amount, status, and card number. This service is built with strong observability using Prometheus, OpenTelemetry, and Zap Logger.


### üîÑ Service Architecture
`TransactionService` is divided into multiple components to ensure scalability and clear separation of concerns:
  - **transactionCommandService**
    Handles write operations: CreateTransaction, UpdateTransaction, TrashedTransaction, RestoreTransaction, and DeleteTransactionPermanent.
  - **transactionQueryService**
    Handles read operations: FindAllTransaction, FindByIdTransaction, FindByCardNumberTransaction, and statistical queries.
  - **transactionStatisticService**
    Provides general transaction statistics for all cards.
  - **transactionStatisticByCardService**
    Provides transaction statistics grouped by card number.

### üìä Monitoring & Observability

#### üìà Prometheus Metrics

Each service exposes the following metrics:
  - **Request Counter**: Total number of requests, labeled by method and status.
  - **Request Duration Histogram**: Measures execution time for each method.

Metric examples:
  - `transaction_query_service_request_total`
  - `transaction_query_service_request_duration_seconds`
  - `transaction_command_service_request_total`
  - `transaction_command_service_request_duration_seconds`
  - `transaction_statistic_service_request_total`
  - `transaction_statistic_service_request_duration_seconds`
  - `transaction_statistic_by_card_service_request_total`
  - `transaction_statistic_by_card_service_request_duration_seconds`

#### üîç OpenTelemetry Tracing

All services are instrumented with their own tracer:
  - `transaction-command-service`
  - `transaction-query-service`
  - `transaction-statistic-service`
  - `transaction-statistic-by-card-service`


### üì¨ Kafka Integration

TransactionService publishes events related to transaction lifecycle (e.g., creation) to Kafka topics. These are consumed by the email-service to send out notification emails.

| Kafka Topic                               | Purpose                                                | Consumer Group        |
| ----------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ | --------------------- |
| `email-service-topic-transaction-created` | Notify users when a transaction (t is successful | `email-service-group` |

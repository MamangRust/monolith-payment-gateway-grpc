# Payment Gateway Topup Service

## Overview

`TopupService` is a monolith responsible for handling balance top-ups. It supports monthly and yearly statistics based on method, amount, status, and card number. This service is built with strong observability using Prometheus, OpenTelemetry, and Zap Logger.


### üîÑ Service Architecture

TopupService is separated into several components for scalability and responsibility separation:
  - **topupCommandService**
    Handles write operations such as CreateTopup, UpdateTopup, TrashedTopup, RestoreTopup, and DeleteTopupPermanent.
  - **topupQueryService**
    Handles read operations such as FindAllTopup, FindByIdTopup, FindByCardNumberTopup, and top-up statistics.
  - **topupStatisticByCardService**
    Provides top-up statistic reports based on card number.
  - **topupStatisticService**
    Provides general top-up statistics (for all cards).

### üìä Monitoring & Observability

#### üìà Prometheus Metrics

Each RPC method includes:
  - **Request Counter**: Total number of requests, labeled by method and status.
  - **Request Duration Histogram**: Measures execution time for each method.

Metric examples:
  - `topup_query_service_request_total`
  - `topup_query_service_request_duration_seconds`
  - `topup_command_service_request_total`
  - `topup_command_service_request_duration_seconds`
  - `topup_statistic_service_request_total`
  - `topup_statistic_service_request_duration_seconds`
  - `topup_statistic_by_card_service_request_total`
  - `topup_statistic_by_card_service_request_duration_seconds`


#### üîç OpenTelemetry Tracing

Each service is instrumented with a dedicated tracer:
  - `topup-command-service`
  - `topup-query-service`
  - `topup-statistic-service`
  - `topup-statistic-by-card-service`

### üì¨ Kafka Integration

The TopupService integrates with Kafka to publish domain events related to top-up transactions. One such event is the top-up creation, which triggers downstream processes like email notifications.

These messages are published to specific Kafka topics and consumed by the email-service, which is responsible for sending out transactional emails such as successful top-up confirmations.

| Kafka Topic                                            | Purpose                                                               | Consumer Group        |
| ------------------------------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------- |
| `email-service-topic-topup-created`                 | Notify user when a new topup is successfully created               | `email-service-group` |

# Payment Gateway Card Service

## Overview

`CardService` is a monolith responsible for card management and balance tracking within the system. It supports a wide range of operations, including card creation, updates, deletions (soft and hard), as well as balance/statistics reporting based on various dimensions such as monthly, yearly, and card number specific views.

This service communicates via gRPC, tracks observability via Prometheus and OpenTelemetry, and integrates with Kafka to publish balance creation events to the saldo-service.


### üîÑ Service Architecture

`CardService` is split into several subservices for clean separation of concerns:

- **CommandService**: Handles create/update/delete and produces Kafka events.
- **QueryService**: Handles all data retrieval operations.
- **DashboardService**: Aggregates metrics for dashboards.
- **StatisticService**: Provides time-based and card-based statistics.

All services are instrumented with:
- **Kafka** to produce and consume balance creation events.
- **Prometheus metrics** to track request counts and durations for observability.
- **OpenTelemetry tracing** to provide distributed tracing for requests, helping with debugging and performance tuning.
- **Structured logging** with Zap for detailed error and operational logs.

### üìä Monitoring & Observability

#### Prometheus Metrics

Each RPC method is instrumented with:
- **Request Counter**: total number of requests by method and status.
- **Request Duration Histogram**: duration of each RPC method execution.

**Metric examples**:
- `card_command_service_requests_total`
- `card_command_service_request_duration_seconds`
- `card_dashboard_request_count`
- `card_dashboard_request_duration_seconds`
- `card_query_service_requests_total`
- `card_query_service_request_duration_seconds`
- `card_statistic_service_requests_total`
- `card_statistic_service_request_duration_seconds`
- `card_statistic_bycard_service_requests_total`
- `card_statistic_bycard_service_request_duration_seconds`

#### üîç Tracing with OpenTelemetry

Each service is assigned a tracer for distributed tracing:
- `card-query-service`
- `card-command-service`
- `card-dashboard-service`
- `card-statistic-service`
- `card-statistic-bycard-service`

### üì¨ Kafka Integration

When a card is created, CardService emits an event to the saldo-service-topic-create-saldo topic.

| Kafka Topic                        | Description                                              | Consumer Group        |
| ---------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------- |
| `saldo-service-topic-create-saldo` | Sent when a new card is created to trigger balance setup | `saldo-service-group` |

# Payment Gateway Transfer Service

## Overview


`TransferService` is a monolith responsible for managing card-to-card transfer transactions. It supports monthly and yearly statistics based on method, amount, status, and card numbers (sender/receiver). This service is built with strong observability using Prometheus, OpenTelemetry, and Zap Logger.


### 🔄 Service Architecture

TransferService is divided into multiple components to ensure scalability and clear separation of concerns:
  - **transferCommandService**
    Handles write operations such as CreateTransfer, UpdateTransfer, TrashedTransfer, RestoreTransfer, and DeleteTransferPermanent.
  - **transferQueryService**
    Handles read operations such as FindAllTransfer, FindByIdTransfer, FindTransferByTransferFrom, FindTransferByTransferTo, and soft-deletion filters.
  - **transferStatisticService**
    Provides general transfer statistics for all cards.
  - **transferStatisticByCardService**
    Provides transfer statistics grouped by sender and receiver card numbers.

### 📊 Monitoring & Observability

#### 📈 Prometheus Metrics

Each service exposes the following metrics:
  - **Request Counter**: Counts all requests per method and status.
  - **Request Duration** Histogram: Measures the latency for each method.

Metric examples:
  - `transfer_query_service_request_total`
  - `transfer_query_service_request_duration_seconds`
  - `transfer_command_service_request_total`
  - `transfer_command_service_request_duration_seconds`
  - `transfer_statistic_service_request_total`
  - `transfer_statistic_service_request_duration_seconds`
  - `transfer_statistic_by_card_service_request_total`
  - `transfer_statistic_by_card_service_request_duration_seconds`


#### 🔍 OpenTelemetry Tracing
All services are instrumented with their own tracer:
  - `transfer-command-service`
  - `transfer-query-service`
  - `transfer-statistic-service`
  - `transfer-statistic-by-card-service`

### 📬 Kafka Integration

`TransferService` publishes events related to transfer lifecycle (e.g., after successful transfer) to Kafka topics. These events are consumed by other services like the email-service to send notifications.

| Kafka Topic                            | Purpose                                               | Consumer Group        |
| -------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- | --------------------- |
| `email-service-topic-transfer-created` | Notify users when a transfer is successfully created. | `email-service-group` |

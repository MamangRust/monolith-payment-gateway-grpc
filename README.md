## Service

### ApiGateway

The API Gateway acts as a single entry point for all client requests, simplifying interactions with various microservices such as `AuthService`, `UserService`, `TransactionService`, and others. Using a framework like Echo, the API Gateway handles several important aspects:

- **Request Routing**: Forwards HTTP requests from clients to the appropriate microservice via gRPC.
- **Security**: Manages authentication and authorization, including JWT token validation.
- **Data Transformation**: Adjusts request and response formats as needed between clients and microservices.


### üîÑ Request Flow Through the API Gateway

Here's a general flow of a client request through the API Gateway:

1. **Client Sends a Request**: An HTTP request is made to the API Gateway.
2. **Validation & Security**: The gateway validates the request, including authentication and authorization.
3. **Routing to Microservice**: The request is forwarded to the appropriate microservice via gRPC.
5. **Response to Client**: The gateway sends the microservice's response back to the client.


----



### Auth Service

`AuthService` is a microservice responsible for **user authentication** and **account management**. It handles core features such as registration, login, password reset, identity verification, and token refreshing. Communication is done via **gRPC**, and email-related events are sent using **Kafka** to an external `email-service`.

---


### üîÑ Service Architecture

The AuthService is organized into multiple specialized service interfaces to separate concerns and improve maintainability:

- **RegistrationService:** Handles user registration and creation of new accounts.
- **LoginService:** Responsible for authenticating users and issuing JWT tokens.
- **PasswordResetService:** Manages the password reset flow, including sending OTP codes, verifying them, and resetting passwords.
- **IdentifyService:** Deals with token refreshing and retrieving information about the authenticated user.

All services integrate with:

- **Kafka** for publishing events like registration confirmations and OTP emails to the email-service.
- **Prometheus metrics** to track request counts and durations for observability.
- **OpenTelemetry tracing** to provide distributed tracing for requests, helping with debugging and performance tuning.
- **Structured logging** with Zap for detailed error and operational logs.

### Merchant Service

The **Merchant Service** is a comprehensive microservice designed to manage merchant accounts, documents, transactions, and analytics within a payment processing ecosystem. It provides both query and command operations through a CQRS (Command Query Responsibility Segregation) pattern and integrates seamlessly with the Auth Service for authentication and authorization.


### üîÑ Service Architecture

The MerchantService is organized into multiple specialized service interfaces to separate responsibilities and improve scalability and maintainability:

  - **MerchantCommandService**
    Handles merchant lifecycle operations such as creation, update, soft delete, restore, and permanent deletion.
    Publishes domain events (e.g., email-service-topic-merchant-created, email-service-topic-merchant-update-status) to Kafka for asynchronous downstream processing.
    Also produces messages to Kafka topics consumed by the email-service-group to notify users when a merchant is approved or rejected.

  - **MerchantQueryService**
    Focuses on data retrieval operations for merchant entities, including paginated listings, filtering (e.g., by status), and fetching individual merchant details. Optimized for performance and scalability.

  - **MerchantDocumentCommandService**
    Manages merchant document operations such as uploading, updating, soft deleting, restoring, and permanently deleting documents.
    Publishes domain events (e.g., email-service-topic-merchant-documents-created, email-service-topic-merchant-documents-update-status) to Kafka, including events consumed by the email-service-group to notify users of document approval status.

  - **MerchantDocumentQueryService**
    Handles retrieval of merchant documents, supports filtering by status (active/trashed), and provides document metadata such as file type, upload date, and current status.

  - **MerchantTransactionService**
    Provides access to merchant-related transaction history and supports querying, filtering, and analytics related to transaction flow and grouping.

  - **MerchantStatisticsService**
    Composed of multiple services responsible for delivering analytics and statistics:
      - **MerchantStatisService**: General analytics across all merchants.
      - **MerchantStatisByApiKeyService**: Metrics and insights scoped by API key.
      - **MerchantStatisByMerchantService**: Analytics scoped per individual merchant entity.

All services are tightly integrated with:
  - **Kafka** ‚Äî Used for producing and consuming domain events such as email-service-topic-merchant-created, email-service-topic-merchant-update-status, email-service-topic-merchant-documents-created, email-service-topic-merchant-documents-update-status, and others.
    Key Kafka topics are consumed by systems like email-service-group to drive asynchronous workflows, including email notifications for merchant and document approvals.

  - **Prometheus metrics** ‚Äî Integrated across all gRPC endpoints to track request counts, durations, and error rates, enabling system observability.

  - **OpenTelemetry tracing** ‚Äî Provides end-to-end distributed tracing across services and infrastructure, allowing fine-grained visibility for debugging and performance optimization.

  - **Structured logging with Zap** ‚Äî Consistent and structured log outputs across all services to support effective monitoring and operational insights.

### Transfer Service
`TransferService` is a microservice responsible for managing card-to-card transfer transactions. It supports monthly and yearly statistics based on method, amount, status, and card numbers (sender/receiver). This service is built with strong observability using Prometheus, OpenTelemetry, and Zap Logger.


### üîÑ Service Architecture

TransferService is divided into multiple components to ensure scalability and clear separation of concerns:
  - **transferCommandService**
    Handles write operations such as CreateTransfer, UpdateTransfer, TrashedTransfer, RestoreTransfer, and DeleteTransferPermanent.
  - **transferQueryService**
    Handles read operations such as FindAllTransfer, FindByIdTransfer, FindTransferByTransferFrom, FindTransferByTransferTo, and soft-deletion filters.
  - **transferStatisticService**
    Provides general transfer statistics for all cards.
  - **transferStatisticByCardService**
    Provides transfer statistics grouped by sender and receiver card numbers.
